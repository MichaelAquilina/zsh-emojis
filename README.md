ZSH Emojis
==========

Contains numerous ascii emojis stored as shell variables.

```
$ echo $em_shrug
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```

All emoji variables start with `em_` to make them easily identifiable with tab-completion in your shell.

On linux you can echo the variables straight into your clipboard with `xsel` package.

```
$ echo $em_shrug | xsel -i -b
```

You can easily see a list of current ascii emojis within the `emojis.plugin.zsh` file.
